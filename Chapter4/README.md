# Deep diving into MLKit with Firebase

In this chapter, we are going to further explore the Google Firebase-based ML Kit platform for mobile applications. Google launched Firebase ML Kit at I/O 2018. The ML Kit is a part of the Firebase application suite that enables developers to incorporate machine learning (ML) capabilities into mobile applications. The Firebase ML Kit Software Development Kit (SDK) comes with a few features that are common among mobile applications, helping Android and iOS developers irrespective of their familiarity with ML. 

The concepts covered throughout the chapter are as follows: 
 - Understanding the basics of the ML Kit 
 - Learning to add Firebase to our applications 
 - Creating multiple applications that can be used for face detection, barcode scanning, and on-device text recognition using Firebase 

This major part of this chapter is from [official quick start samples](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android).

Customed feature:
1. Face detection
2. Barcode scanning
3. Text recognition

## Compile
Import the project into Android Studio.
`google-sevices.json` is gitignored under `app/`. Thus u should add your own config json file there.
