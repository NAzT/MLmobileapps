# Fast Style Transfer, CoreML, TensorFlow

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/intrepidkarthi/MLmobileapps.git
```

## Dependencies

* Xcode 9
* Python 2.7
* TensorFlow (1.0.0 works best with fast-style-transfer, and 1.1.0 or greater for tf-coreml)
* Fast Style Transfer: https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer
* TensforFlow-CoreML: https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml


## iOS

Once you have your models, just import them into the Xcode project. The current setup looks for a particular set of models (wave, udnie, rain_princess, and la_muse)
