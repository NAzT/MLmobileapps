ML is a concept that describes the process of a set of generic algorithms analyzing your data, and providing you with interesting data without writing any specific codes for your problem. Alternatively, we can look at ML as a black box how cutting edge scientists are using it to do something crazy like detecting epilepsy or cancer disease, yet your simple email inbox is using it to filter spam every day. 

On a larger level, ML can be classified into the following two categories: 
  - Supervised learning 
  - Unsupervised learning 
  
We will discuss one example of Supervised learning in this Chapter.

Run the code by using the follwing command:

```
python linear.py
```

You can see the final output on the chart.
