# Mobile Landscapes in Machine Learning 

Computers are improving by the day, and device form factors are changing tremendously. In the past, we would only see computers at offices, but now we see them on our home desks, on our laps, in our pockets, and on our wrists. The market is becoming increasingly varied as machines are being equipped with more and more intelligence. 

Almost every adult currently carries a device around with them, and it is estimated that we look at our smartphones at least 50 times a day, whether there is a need to or not. These machines affect our daily decision-making processes. Devices are now equipped with applications such as Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, or Cortana, features that are designed to mimic human intelligence. The ability to answer any query thrown at them presents these types of technology as master humans. On the backend, these systems improve using the collective intelligence acquired from all users. The more you interact with virtual assistants, the better are the results they give out. 

Despite these advancements, how much closer are we to creating a human brain through a machine? We are in 2018 now. If science discovers a way to control the neurons of our brain, this may be possible in the near future. Machines that mimic the capabilities of a human are helping to solve complex textual, visual, and audio problems. They resemble the tasks carried out by a human brain on a daily basisâ€”on average, the human brain makes approximately 35,000 decisions in a day. 

ML is a concept that describes the process of a set of generic algorithms analyzing your data, and providing you with interesting data without writing any specific codes for your problem. Alternatively, we can look at ML as a black box how cutting edge scientists are using it to do something crazy like detecting epilepsy or cancer disease, yet your simple email inbox is using it to filter spam every day. 

On a larger level, ML can be classified into the following two categories: 
  - Supervised learning 
  - Unsupervised learning 
  
We will discuss one example of Supervised learning in this Chapter.

Run the code by using the follwing command:

```
python linear.py
```

You can see the final output on the chart.
